      I am currently learning multiple different languages, frameworks, and design apps including: HTML, CSS, Sketch APP, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, and Ember at a fast pace. This has taught me to work well with other programmers through problems that sometimes seem impossible. My skills as a programmer have significantly increased learning to adjust to a real work-like environment with other programmers, using each other to help problem solve solutions.
